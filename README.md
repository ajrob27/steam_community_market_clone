## Welcome!

This project is just as it sounds, a clone of the [Steam Community Market](http://steamcommunity.com/market). This project is built by [AJ Robertson](https://github.com/ajrob27), with the elixir-lang framework Phoenix, for the purpose of learning.

Please feel free to reach out to [AJ](https://github.com/ajrob27) via [email](mailto:ajrob27@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ajrob27) if you have any questions. 

## Market

To start your Phoenix app:

  1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  2. Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  3. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).
